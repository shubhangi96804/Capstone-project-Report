Project Details
🏏 IPL Capstone Project – Data-Driven Cricket Analytics (SQL | Power BI | Python)

The Indian Premier League (IPL), one of the biggest sporting events globally, generates vast amounts of match data every season. This project aims to leverage IPL historical datasets to extract actionable insights for teams, players, and fans using SQL, Python, and Power BI. The focus is on uncovering performance patterns, optimizing strategies, and building a visual storytelling dashboard that enhances cricket analytics.
🔍 Project Objectives

    Analyze match-by-match and ball-by-ball data from 2008 to 2024.
    Provide franchises with insights for player auctions, strategy planning, and match forecasting.
    Build SQL queries, data visualizations, and dashboards to uncover trends in performance and gameplay.

🔗 Dataset Overview

    Match-level records including team names, venues, and winners.
    Player performance data: runs, wickets, economy, strike rate.
    Ball-by-ball delivery data for 100K+ balls.
    Team metadata and player information.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

    SQL (MySQL) for querying insights from relational databases.
    Power BI/Tableau for creating interactive dashboards.
    Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib) for EDA and advanced visualizations.

📐 SQL Analysis Highlights

    Identified top batsman and bowlers by total runs, economy, and balls faced.
    Calculated team-wise total runs, extras conceded, and overs bowled.
    Measured batsman efficiency using strike rate and average runs per ball.
    Derived win percentages and found all-rounders based on dual-role player data.

📊 Power BI Dashboards (6 Pages)

    Season Highlights
        Matches played, total runs, sixes/fours, winning margins per season.
    Team Performance
        Win %, toss decision impact, finals performance, and H2H records.
    Player Statistics
        Top scorers, wicket-takers, six-hitters, player of the match, all-rounders.
    Venue Analysis
        Best venues, team-wise venue performance, home vs away success.
    Match Situations
        Chasing vs defending wins, performance in overs (PP, middle, death), pressure handling.
    Season Trends
        Player participation, run totals, strike rate evolution, bowling economy trends.

📈 Python EDA Insights

    Cleaned and merged multi-table IPL datasets.
    Analyzed run trends, batting strike rates, and boundary conversion by player type.
    Measured bowling efficiency with dot balls, average, and economy.
    Compared overs-based performance (e.g., death vs powerplay overs).
    Visualized venue behavior in high vs low-scoring matches.
    (Optional) Built a basic match-winner prediction model based on historical performance.

✅ Outcome

This end-to-end capstone project demonstrates expertise in data engineering, statistical analysis, visual storytelling, and domain-specific analytics. It provides a comprehensive view of how cricket data can be used to make informed decisions across all levels—from fans to franchises.
